Follow core software development principles:
  - TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests first, then implement the functionality
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication, extract reusable components
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Choose simple solutions over complex ones
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't implement functionality until it's necessary
  - Follow Single Responsibility Principle.
